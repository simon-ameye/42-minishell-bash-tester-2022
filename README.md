# 42-minishell_bash_tester_2022
Simple tester for 42 minishell project

## Tested :
- everything
- even exit
- and of course leaks using valgrind (readline leaks ignored)
- heredoc, exit status, pipes, redirect, special files opening
- ...

## Install :
1) Clone the repo
2) Set your minishell path ```minishell_dir=``` in tester.sh
